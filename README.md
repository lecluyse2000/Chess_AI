# Chess AI

I'm going to build a chess ai. No tutorial or libraries. No gui most likely. The only prior knowledge I have is that you can use `uint64_t` to respresent a chessboard.  

The goal is for the AI to be able to beat me, an 1100 rated player.  

Using c++20 and CMake. The more I code in C the more data oriented my programming becomes.

Documentation will be sparse for awhile, as the engine is under development.
